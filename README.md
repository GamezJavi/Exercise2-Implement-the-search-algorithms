# Exercise2-Implement-the-search-algorithms
The program receives an N given argument, a value to search for, and then the program reads the N numbers to search among. The output of the program should show whether or not the value given by the parameter was found and the number of comparisons that had to be made to determine it. 
The numbers to look for can be obtained from the file "10MillonesNumeros".
