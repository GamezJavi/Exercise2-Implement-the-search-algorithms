# Exercise2-Implement-the-search-algorithms
Adapt the program to receive an N given by argument, a value to search for, and then the program read the N numbers among which it will perform the search. Implement in your program what is necessary so that vector A meets the prerequisites of the search type.
The output of the program should show if the value given by parameter was found or not and the number of comparisons that had to be made to determine it.
The numbers to look for can be obtained from the file "10MillonesNumeros".
